I'm working with Mitch Wand on reasoning about higher-order and imperative programs. Before coming to Boston I was living in Greece, where I got my undergraduate degree from the National Technical University of Athens. When I have the chance, I like traveling, swimming, reading a good book, watching movies, and playing with unix. "))))
