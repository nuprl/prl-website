My thesis research involves proposing changes to Java that remove the need for its \"null\" value by providing safer alternatives. Specifically, Java programmers use null in two primary ways: to indicate that a field (local variable, etc.) is uninitialized, and as a rough encoding of the ML OPTION type. I intend to address these uses by proposing a new object initialization mechanism that removes the need for uninitialized values and by adding a safer two-way disjoint union to the language.")))))
