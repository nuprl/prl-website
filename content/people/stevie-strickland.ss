(provide me)(define me (quote (person "Stevie Strickland" (group "Students") (picture "gallery/strickland.jpg") (homepage "http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/sstrickl/") (bio "After spending six years at Georgia Tech as both an undergrad and a grad student I came to Northeastern in 2004 for a change in scenery and to pursue a PhD degree. I took a break for a couple of years to work in industry after my first year, so I'm currently a second year student. My research interests in the area of programming languages include efficiently implementing functional languages and type theory, and I'm currently doing research for Matthias Felleisen."))))
