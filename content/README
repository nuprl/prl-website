The PRL website is automatically generated from this here content/ directory.
The people/ and pubs/ subdirectories are themselves automatically copied from
user directories, and from centralized-people/ and centralized-pubs/.


In other words:
  usernames             # edit this to add your username
  centralized-people/   # move your bio to ~/.prl/bio.ss
  centralized-pubs/     # if possible, move infomation to ~/.prl/pubs.{bib,ss}
  gallery/              # move your picture into ~/.prl/static/
                        #   and update bio.ss with the new relative URL
  people/               # (automatically generated from centralized-people/ and ~*/.prl/bio.ss)
  pubs/                 # (automatically generated from centralized-pubs/ and ~*/.prl/pubs.{bib,ss})

See below for more explanation.



== To update your information ==

Add your username to the 'usernames' file in this directory.  

Create a .prl/ directory in your home directory.

If your information is still in centralized-*/ from the previous version of the
website, you'll want to remove it from there.  centralized-people/ has one file
per person, but centralized-pubs/ is more complicated; it makes sense to
continue maintaining group files like 'plt.ss' there still.


=== Bio and picture  ===

If you already have information up on the PRL website, there should be a file
named after you in the people/ directory.  Copy that to your .prl directory, and
rename it "bio.ss".

Otherwise, create a new "bio.ss" file.  An example follows:
 #lang scheme
 (provde me)
 (define me
   '(person "Paul Erdos"
      (group "Visitors") ;One of "Faculty" "Research Scientists" "Visitors" 
                         ;       "Students" "Alumni" "Former Members"
      (picture "static-perdos/pic.jpg")
      (homepage "http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/perdos/")
      (bio "I can be trusted")))


=== Publications ===

For your publications you'll want either a BibTex file called pubs.bib, or a
Scheme file called pubs.ss:
 #lang scheme
 (provide bib)
 (define bib
   '(
     (publication
      (authors "Paul Erdos" "Kevin Bacon")
      (title "On Small-World Connectivity")
      (date ((month "August") (year 2012)))
      (download ((format "PDF") (link "http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/perdos/papers/small-world.pdf")))
      (download ((format "DVI") (link "http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/perdos/papers/small-world.dvi")))
      (published "ICFP"))
     (publication
      (authors "Paul Erdos" "Frodo Baggins")
      (title "A Theory of Rings of Order One")
      (date ((year 2001)))
      (published "Middle-Earth Studies Workshop")
      (download ((format "PDF") (link "http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/perdos/papers/1rings.pdf")))
      (note "This area of research " (a ((href "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum")) "has been known")
            " to cause insanity."))))

If you use a Scheme file you'll be able to do some useful formatting.


=== Formatting ===

The 'bio' field in bio.ss and the 'authors', 'title', 'published' and 'note'
fields in pubs.ss accept arbitrary X-expressions (an S-expression-based
representation of XML).  So, to represent the following fragment of XHTML:

 <div>
  The <em>quick</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown">brown</a>
  fox jumped  <hr class="over" style="width: 50%"/>  the lazy dog.
 </div>

...you would write

 (div
  "The " (em "quick") " " (a ((href "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown") "brown"))
  " fox jumped " (hr ((class "over") (style "width: 50%"))) " the lazy dog.")


=== Hosting static files ===

Also, if you have files you want to host (probably your picture and copies of
papers), you can put them in a .prl/static directory.  You can refer to them
with the relative URL "static-<username>/<filename>".  Note that deletion has to
happen manually
