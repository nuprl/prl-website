(provide me)(define me (quote (person "Viera K. Proulx" (group "Faculty") (picture "gallery/proulx2.jpg") (homepage "http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/vkp/") (bio " I got my Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1977, and I've been at Northeastern ever since. I've always liked languages - whether programming or native or foreign - and recently joined the PL group. I am especially interested in teaching program design and creating artifacts to support learning. In my spare time I like mountains - to climb and ski, water to swim in and paddle on, and music of many kinds. "))))
