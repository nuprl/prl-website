I came to Northeastern in 2007 with advisor Pete Manolios. My broad interests include tools and techniques for development of correct systems. Specifically, I have made contributions to explicit-state model checkers including Spin, Murphi, and Java Pathfinder. I have also written a development environment for the ACL2 theorem prover called ACL2s (for \"ACL2 Sedan\")."))))
