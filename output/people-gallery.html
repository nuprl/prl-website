                         I got my Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1977, and I've been at 
                         Northeastern ever since. I've always liked languages - whether programming 
                         or native or foreign - and recently joined the PL group. I am especially 
                         interested in teaching program design and creating artifacts to support 
                         learning. In my spare time I like mountains - to climb and ski, water to 
                         swim in and paddle on, and music of many kinds.

summer 2008.  My thesis research involves proposing changes to Java
that remove the need for its "null" value by providing safer
alternatives.  Specifically, Java programmers use null in two primary
ways: to indicate that a field (local variable, etc.) is
uninitialized, and as a rough encoding of the ML OPTION type.  I
intend to address these uses by proposing a new object initialization
mechanism that removes the need for uninitialized values and by adding
a safer two-way disjoint union to the language.</td></tr><tr><td> <img src="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/prl/gallery/Ryan_Culpepper.jpg" width="150px" /></td><td width="350px"><h3> <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/ryanc/">Ryan Culpepper</a></h3>  Born in Houston, TX, left, went back to go
